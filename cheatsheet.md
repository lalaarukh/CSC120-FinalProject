You need 8 points to win this game.

# SPOILER ALERT

If your game includes challenges that must be overcome to win, also list them below.

The game goes through 3 rounds: 

**Round 1**

This round has riddles, they will be printed randomly. Here are the riddles with their answers:

"I have a head like a cat and feet like a cat, but I am not a cat. What am I?", "Kitten"

"I have cities, but no houses. I have mountains, but no trees. I have water, but no fish.", "Map"

**Round 2**
This round has math questions, they will be printed randomly. Here are the questions with their answers:
"If there are 4 apples and you take away 3, how many do you have?", "1"
"If eggs are $0.12 a dozen, how many eggs can you get for a dollar?", "100"
"When Mitch was 6 years old, his little sister, Lila, was half his age. If Mitch is 40 years old today, how old is Lila?", "37"
"How many days are there in 4 years?", "1461"
"You are given 3 positive numbers. You can add these numbers and multiply them together. The result you get will be the same. Which are the numbers?", "1,2,3"
"If you multiply this number by any other number, the answer will always be the same. What number is this?", "0"
"I am an odd number; take away an alphabet, and I become even. What number am I?", "7"
"If it were two hours later, it would be half as long until midnight as it would be if it were an hour later. What time is it now?", "9"
"If 2 is company and 3 is a crowd, what are 4 and 5?", "9"

**Round 3**

This round is somewhat arbitrary. Theoretically, you can win or lose this. You have to guess a randomly generated combination of 3 numbers and there is no way (that I have figured out) to rig that.
